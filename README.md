I need to write a linkedin post about an academic article I helped write being published on frontiers.  The class was for a part of my graduate program at the time last year, and I myself am a baseball player, as well as two more of us in the group that did it.  As well as that there was a softball player.  In saying that, we chose to do a paper on the effects of walk up songs in college baseball.  I can attach the pdf to help provide context, in case you feel a summary is necessary in the post.  I need to thank the College of Education at Clemson University for the opportunity to be a part of this, and i need to thank Clemson Libraries for giving us the means to get this done the right way.  My group members were Matthew MArchal, Matthew Eric, Taylor Roby, Chase Hughes, and me Rob Hughes.  Would also like to show appreciation for our graduate school professors Mike Godfrey and Sarah Stowkowski for their guidance, partnership, and the ability to make a bunch of grad school athletes pour into something.
